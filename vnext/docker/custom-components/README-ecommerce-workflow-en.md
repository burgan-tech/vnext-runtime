## 🔄 E-Commerce Workflow Flow

### Overview

This workflow simulates a complete e-commerce experience and includes the following states:

### Workflow States & Flow

#### 1. 🔐 Authentication (Initial State)
- **Entry Action:** Login task is executed
- **Success Case:** Transitions to Product Browsing state
- **Failure Case:** Remains in Authentication state (retry)

#### 2. 🛒 Product Browsing (Intermediate State)

#### 3. 🛍️ Cart Management (Intermediate State)  
- **Entry Action:** Selected product is added to cart
- **User Actions:**
  - Proceed to checkout → Transitions to Order Processing state
  - Continue shopping → Returns to Product Browsing state

#### 4. 📦 Order Processing (Intermediate State)
- **Entry Action:** Order is processed
- **Success Case:** Transitions to Order Confirmation state  
- **Payment Failure:** Returns to Cart Management state

#### 5. ✅ Order Confirmation (Final State)

## 🔧 Testing

1. Open the `ecommerce-workflow.http` file in an HTTP client (VS Code REST Client, Postman, etc.)
2. Execute requests in sequence:
   - First, run the "Start Shopping" request
   - Get the `id` value from the response and replace it in other request URLs
   - Execute other requests in order

## 📝 Notes

- Automatic actions are executed when entering each state (login task, product fetch, cart add, order process)
- The `availableTransitions` array returned at each step shows the next possible actions
- The `currentState` field indicates which state the workflow is in
- State transitions can be made as long as the workflow instance is active
- In failure cases (login failure, payment failure), the workflow returns to the relevant state
- Order Confirmation is the final state and the workflow ends here

## 🌐 Headers

The following headers are used in test requests:
- `Accept-Language`: For localization (tr-TR)
- `X-Request-Id`: Unique ID for request tracking
- `X-Device-Id`: Device identification
- `X-Token-Id`: Token identification  
- `X-Device-Info`: Device information
- `X-Forwarded-For`: IP address information
