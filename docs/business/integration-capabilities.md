# Integration Capabilities

This section outlines how the vNext Workflow Engine integrates with enterprise systems and modern microservice architectures.

## At a glance

- **Purpose**: Describe integration surfaces and patterns (REST, Dapr, events, routing).
- **Best for**: Architects evaluating fit into existing enterprise integration landscapes.
- **Key questions answered**: How does it connect to systems, services, and events?

## REST API for external systems

- Start workflows and drive transitions from external applications (web, mobile, back-office)
- Query instance state for status tracking and customer-facing updates
- Support integration with existing enterprise platforms (CRM, core banking, ERP, case management)

## Dapr integration for microservices

- Use Dapr building blocks for service invocation, pub/sub, state, and secrets
- Standardize integrations across heterogeneous tech stacks
- Improve resiliency in distributed communication patterns

## Event-driven architecture support

- Enable workflows to react to business events (e.g., “payment received”, “document verified”)
- Support asynchronous processing and decoupled system design
- Facilitate real-time operational responses without tight coupling

## Multi-domain routing

- Support routing and isolation across business domains (e.g., retail, SME, corporate)
- Allow domain-specific policies, configurations, and operational boundaries
